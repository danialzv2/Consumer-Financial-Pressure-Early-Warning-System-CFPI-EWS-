# Consumer-Financial-Pressure-Early-Warning-System-CFPI-EWS-
Built an automated macro stress index using fuel, inflation, FX and OPR data. Deployed Machine Learning to predict pressure acceleration and scheduled end-to-end MLOps via GitHub Actions

1. Problem Statement
Financial institutions and fintech platforms often react to consumer stress only after churn, fraud, or default occurs. Internal transaction signals appear late, reducing the effectiveness of early intervention and increasing business risk.

2. Objectives
    - Build a macro-level early warning indicator for consumer financial pressure
	- Integrate fuel, inflation, FX, and OPR signals into a unified index
	- Predict short term pressure acceleration using machine learning
	- Automate the full pipeline with reproducible MLOps

3. End Goal
Deliver a production-ready Consumer Financial Pressure Early Warning System (CFPI-EWS) that provides timely, interpretable signals to support proactive risk, pricing, and retention decisions.

4. Benefits

For financial institutions & fintechs:
- Earlier risk detection before behavioral changes appear
- Better timing of credit tightening and incentive strategies
- Reduced reliance on lagging internal indicators

For consumers:
- More responsible credit exposure management
- Reduced aggressive marketing during high-stress periods
- Improved financial system stability
